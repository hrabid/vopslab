Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by **John Gruber** in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages. It is widely used for formatting readme files, writing messages in online discussion forums, and creating rich text using a plain text editor.

This tutorial will cover everything you need to know about Markdown, from basic syntax to advanced features. Let's dive in!

---
## Basic Syntax

### Headings

Headings are created by adding one or more `#` symbols before the heading text. The number of `#` symbols corresponds to the heading level.

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```

### Paragraphs and Line Breaks

To create a paragraph, leave a blank line between lines of text. To create a line break, end a line with two or more spaces.

```markdown
This is a paragraph.

This is another paragraph.  
This is a new line in the same paragraph.
```

### Bold and Italic

- **Bold**: Wrap text with `**` or `__`.
- *Italic*: Wrap text with `*` or `_`.

```markdown
**This is bold text**  
__This is also bold text__  

*This is italic text*  
_This is also italic text_  

**_This is bold and italic text_**
```
### Underline
Markdown doesn't have built-in syntax for underline, but it can be achieved by html `<u>` or `<ins>` tag.
```markdown
<u>An underlined text</u>
<ins>also an underlined text</ins>
```
### Blockquotes

Blockquotes are created by adding a `>` before the text.

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
> 
> This is another line in the blockquote.
```

### Lists

#### Unordered Lists

Use `-`, `*`, or `+` to create unordered lists.

```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2
* Item 3
+ Item 4
```

#### Ordered Lists

Use numbers followed by a period to create ordered lists.

```markdown
8. First item
9. Second item
   10. Subitem 2.1
   11. Subitem 2.2
12. Third item
```

### Code

- Inline code: Wrap text with `` ` ``.
- Code blocks: Wrap text with ``` ``` ``` or indent with four spaces.

```markdown
This is `inline code`.

```
This is a code block.
```markdown

	This is also a code block.
```

### Horizontal Rules

Create a horizontal rule by using three or more `-`, `*`, or `_` characters.

```markdown
---
***
___
```

### Files Links
#### Link to a URL
Create links using `[text](URL)`.

```markdown
[Google](https://www.google.com)
```
#### Link to a Heading 
```markdown
[[#Basic Syntax]]
[[Markdown links#Links]]
```

#### Link to heading of another file
```markdown
[[anatomy-of-git-dir#`.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG`]]
```

#### Embedding a file
```markdown
[[public/fontawesome-6/svgs/brands/markdown.svg]]
```
#### Images

Add images using `![alt text](image URL)`.

```markdown
![Markdown Logo](https://markdown-here.com/img/icon256.png)
```

## Extended Syntax

### Tables

Create tables using `|` and `-`.

```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data 1   | Data 2   |
| Row 2    | Data 3   | Data 4   |
```

### Task Lists

Create task lists using `- [ ]` for incomplete tasks and `- [x]` for completed tasks.

```markdown
- [x] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3
```

### Strikethrough

Wrap text with `~~` to create strikethrough text.

```markdown
~~This is strikethrough text.~~
```

### Emoji

Use `:emoji_name:` to add emojis.

```markdown
:smile: :heart: :rocket:
```
### Footnotes

Add footnotes using `[^label]` and define them at the bottom of the document.

```markdown
Here is a footnote reference[^1].

[^1]: This is the footnote.
```

### Highlighting

Wrap text with `==` to highlight it.

```markdown
This is ==highlighted text==.
<mark>This is a marked text</mark>
```

### Subscript and Superscript

- Subscript: Wrap text with `~`.
- Superscript: Wrap text with `^`.

```markdown
H~2~O  
E = mc^2^
```
HTML subscript & superscript tag also supported:
```markdown
H<sub>2</sub>O
E = mc<sup>2</sup>
```
### Expandable & Collapsible Sections
```markdown
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

  Hidden content goes here.
</details>
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep It Simple**: Use Markdown for its simplicity. Avoid overcomplicating your documents.
2. **Use Consistent Formatting**: Stick to one style for headings, lists, and other elements.
3. **Preview Your Work**: Always preview your Markdown to ensure it renders correctly.
4. **Use Comments Sparingly**: Markdown doesn’t support comments, but some processors allow HTML comments (`<!-- comment -->`).
